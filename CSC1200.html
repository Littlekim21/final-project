    <h1> CSC 1200 Functional Programming I</h1>
    <p>(formerly CSC 120; CSC 111</p>
    <p>This course provides an accelerated introduction to computer programming in scripting language, such as JavaScript, Python or Ruby using a functional programming
         style. The emphasis of the course will be on developing logical and algorithmic problem solving skills. Students will learn how to state problems precisely and reason about the 
         correctness of their code. Topics include function composition, basic string processing, Booleans and truth tables, conditional statements, loops implemented by 
         backward and forward tail recursion, Arrays and higher-order functions. Students will apply their knowledge to the partial development of an open source project, 
         such as a spreadsheet web application.</p>
