        <h1>CSC 1030 Visual Programming </h1>
    <p>(also CIS 1030; formerly CIS/CSC 103; Visual Basic-Object Oriented Programming I; Programming in Visual Basic)</p>
    <p>An introduction to computer programming through the use of drag-and-drop code blocks. The purpose of the course is to provide an introduction to programming logic and algorithmic problem solving strategies for students with little to no prior programming experience. Students will learn how to use the basic programming constructs such as variables, conditional statement, lists, loops and functions to solve problems by assembling and customizing blocks of code. They will also see how the visual blocks generate actual code and learn how to write some of their own in a friendly beginner language such as Python.</p>
